            A man came to a grocery store. He picked bread, cereals, and
a few other things of daily usage, and went to the cashier
to pay for them. The cashier scanned the items and asked for $20. The man
to out is wallet and opened it. He only had a $10 note in is wallet.  He looked at the note and then at the items he was buying.
The cashier was watching him. He could tell that the man really needed all those things, but did not have enough money to buy.
The man then asked the cashier to take some things out. By that time, another man was behind the first one to pay for his grocery shopping. He was watching everything.
Before the cashier could reply, he carefully slipped a $10 note into the first man’s pocket. The cashier saw it happen. “Sir, you should look in your pockets. I am sure, you will
find another $10 note in there somewhere.” He said to the first man. The man searched his pockets, and found a $10 note in there. He smiled with relief, and paid
for his grocery and went home. The cashier gave the other man a smile, who nodded and smiled back, and without saying anything, paid for his grocery and went out.
Happiness and inner peace do not come from getting richer or earning money. They come from being useful, kind, and compassionate to others, by making a difference in someone’s life. If you make positive things happen to others, and fill their lives with hope, it will surely light up your own life with hope, too, and this world can become a much better place to live in.

        <p>Once a dog ran into a museum filled with mirrors. The museum was very unique, the walls, the ceiling, the doors and even the floors were made of mirrors. Seeing his reflections, the dog froze in surprise in the middle of the hall. He could see a whole pack of dogs surrounding him from all sides, from above and below. The dog bared his teeth and barked all the reflections responded to it in the same way. Frightened, the dog barked frantically, the dog’s reflections imitated the  dog and increased it many times. The dog barked even harder, but the echo was magnified. The dog, tossed from one side to another while his reflections also tossed around snapping their teeth.Next morning, the museum security guards found the miserable, lifeless dog, surrounded by thousands of reflections of the lifeless dog. There was nobody to harm the dog. The dog died by fighting with his own reflections. The world doesn’t bring good or evil on its own. Everything that is happening around us is the reflection of our own thoughts, feelings, wishes and actions. The World is a big mirror. So let’s strike a good pose!</p></div>
